# Template Method
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, called template method, allowing to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. In this template method, one or more algorithm steps can be overridden by subclasses to allow differing behaviors while ensuring that the overarching algorithm is still followed.
